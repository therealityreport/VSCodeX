This repo contains the `codex-mcp-server` project, an MCP server that bridges ChatGPT Apps to the Codex CLI (served at `/mcp` and typically exposed via ngrok for ChatGPT to call). See `codex-mcp-server/README.md` for usage details and `codex-mcp-server/PM_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` for the recommended system prompt.
